Each instance of ReentrantReadWriteLock is used to protect the access of one resource.
If it has multiple instances of ReadLock or WriteLock, 
it will just make the control of the access more complicated.
Because it will have to check how many and what kind of locks are held.
It's much simple by using single instance of ReadLock and WriteLock each.
As long as the WriteLock cannot be shared and cannot be co-held with ReadLock, 
the access of the resource will be safe.
Singleton implementation will ensure this.
