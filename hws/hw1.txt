Generally in Java, programming to interface is preferred over implementation.

Extending from Thread means a new implementation of the Thread class.
So your code may need to consider any rules or limitations with the parent class.

Use the Runnable interface is more flexible since only the run method is required.
It permits you to extend it from another parent class.
Another benefit is that the same Runnable instance can by shared by multiple threads.
