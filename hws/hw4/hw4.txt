Editor with autosave function possible race condition:
1. Editor called change(), set changed to true
2. AutoSaver called save(), be swapped out before set changed to false
3. Editor called save()
4. Editor called change() again and set changed to true
5. AutoSaver regain cpu time, set changed to false
Now the File is in a inconsistent state as changed does not reflect real state.
